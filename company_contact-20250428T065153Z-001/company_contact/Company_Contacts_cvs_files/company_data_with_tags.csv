However, beginning in June there have been fewer offers (though still multiple) on individual properties, more negotiating, and in some instances, cancellation of contracts. Several things could be contributing to this: the season (graduations, vacations, etc.), buyer fatigue (with some buyers feeling they cannot compete in this environment), global uncertainty (Greece, China), or a possibility of the market peaking. This next quarter will be an important one to watch and see where the market is headed. Will it continue to be a seller’s market, or will the playing field level out to be more balanced? Buyers may have a reason to be optimistic as well; there is a general historical trend of increased overall inventory moving into the summer and fall. This probably won't translate into a softening of prices, but it will offer buyers more options in their home searches.
